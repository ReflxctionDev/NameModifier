# Name Modifier
**NameModifier** is a simple MinecraftForge-1.8.9 modification which allows the player to apply fake names, which only affects the client chat.

This can be useful for people who have plans to change their Minecraft usernames, but are unsure how it would look, and would help them make the best decision based on real-like thoughts.

# Commands:
**Command**: /namemodifier, **aliases**: /nm
* /nm name \[alias: setname] - Sets the fake name
* /nm toggle - Toggles the mod (if enabled, gets disabled. If disabled, gets enabled.)
* /nm check - Toggles whether the mod should check for updates on game startup.
* /nm update - Updates the mod from the latest JAR release from the GitHub repository.
